Ye, though I walk through the valley of death (I know)
Ye, though I walk through the valley of death

Fokus auf das Kreuz, yeah, it is finished
Bruder, bei mir läuft, leb' jetzt in Spirit (huh)
Mit meinem Gott, no limits (ey)
Keiner kann mich jemals stoppen, mein Rücken ist Gott (Gott)
Im Tal des Todes, aber Boy, I won't stop (no)
The Lord is my shepherd, the Lord is my rock (wuh)
Mein Herz zu keepen, das' mein einziger Job
C-c-c-comparison kills calling, ab heut gönn' ich jedem seinen Hak (yeah)
Weil ich weiß, Gott hat für mich einen Platz (ah)

Act like a serpent, see Jesus in person, no way
