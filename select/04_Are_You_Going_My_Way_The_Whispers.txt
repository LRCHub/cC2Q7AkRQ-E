Kiss me, then kiss me again come take full
Advantage of this human shell my heart is living in
And love me, ooohwee (love me baby)
And to make life complete promise me lady
That we'll practice making babies while the
World is sound asleep
Whoaho, I love you girl, (I love you) don't tease me (don't)
Make me your future or lock me in your history
I'm the fork in the road, which way will you go
I'd like to know are you going my way
Where dreams come true every day
Are you going my way where true love is
Just a touch away baby
Are you going, are you going, are you going, are you?
Really, really really, really, really going my way baby
Yeah, umhumm and if you really need me, if

If time doesn't rob me, I'll master your body
We'll be closer than Siamese twins
And like the air you breathe I'll supply your needs
And so our story begins, I'll put the bolt lock on the door
And gently lay in the house on the floor
And patiently baby I'll undo your clothes
We'll share our hearts, bodies, and souls
And finally with your permission, we'll
Make sweet love in all positions
And with pleasure we'll tremble love's perfect symbols
If you just answer girl are you going my way
Where dreams come true every day
Are you going my way?
Where true love is just a touch away
Girl, are you going my way
Girl are you going
