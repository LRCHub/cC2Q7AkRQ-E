Two cups, pour me up a A
New drugs do you want a taste
New girl, from around the way
New car, do you wanna race
Why these niggas in my way
High key, all these niggas lame
Nike, checking out the game
Cartier, all up on my frames
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way

Running up the money, come up and go
Everyday im balling on my own
Remember, I don't want to be alone
Now I gotta get it in my own
I ain't ever going broke
I ain't ever loving a hoe
Even tho im sluttin on the low
Bitches always frontin on the low
I just wanna pull up in the rolls
Always rocking pretty niggas clothes
Ksubi jeans with the vlone
Always got ksuni jeans on
Always got pinkey rings on
Get the green, put the team on
Get the grin, put the team on
That's how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
Im in slow mo
Get the green, put the team on
Get the grin, put the team on
Thats how that go
Double cup, get my lean on
Double cup, get my lean on
Im in slow mow
Get the green, put the team on
Get the grin, put the team on

Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
Everything is going my way
